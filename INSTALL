This package uses automake

        $ python -c "import sys; print sys.prefix"
            # make a note of the python prefix

To build from CVS:
	$ ./autogen.sh --prefix=<python_prefix>
or to build from a snapshot release:
        $ ./configure --prefix=<python_prefix>

After that, standard build procedures apply:

        $ make
        # make install

If you're installing to another prefix than the one where Python is installed
Python will not be able to find the cairo module until you add
$prefix/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages to the PYTHONPATH variable.

If libsvg-cairo, PyGTK or Numeric Python are detected optional modules will
be compiled.
However, if PyGTK >= 2.7.0 is detected then cairo.gtk is not built since
pycairo is now supported directly by PyGTK.

To disable PyGTK support use

    $ ./configure --without-pygtk
