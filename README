Pycairo - Python bindings for cairo
http://www.cairographics.org/pycairo

Compiling
---------
See the INSTALL document for build instructions.

Dependencies
------------
    cairo  		>= 1.2.0
    Python 		>= 2.3


Not required, but supported if they are detected:
    libsvg-cairo	>= 0.1.6
    Numeric Python	any version (?)
    PyGTK		2.2.0 <= version < 2.7.0

PyGTK and the cairo.gtk module:
PyGTK 2.8 and above has built in support for cairo and does not need to use the
cairo.gtk module. The cairo.gtk module is deprecated and will be removed from
a future version of pycairo.

libsvg-cairo and the cairo.svg module:
libsvg-cairo is no longer actively maintained. Instead a recommended cairo-SVG
library is pyrsvg (part of python-gnome-desktop) which is a Python binding of
the librsvg library. The cairo.svg module is deprecated and will be removed
from a future version of pycairo.
